This project is a web-based application for automated **brain tumor detection** from MRI images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to assist medical professionals and patients by providing fast, AI-based preliminary diagnostics. The app is built using **Flask** as the web framework, **TensorFlow/Keras** for the deep learning model, and **MongoDB Atlas** to store patient records and prediction results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Image Upload**  
   Users input personal details and upload a brain MRI image through a web form.

2. **Image Preprocessing**  
   The uploaded image is resized to `128x128`, converted into an array, normalized, and reshaped to match the CNN model's input.

3. **Prediction**  
   The CNN model (`braintumor_binary.h5`) predicts whether a tumor is present.
   - If the output > 0.5 ‚Üí **Tumor Detected**
   - If the output ‚â§ 0.5 ‚Üí **No Tumor Detected**
   - A confidence score is also provided.

4. **Database Logging (MongoDB)**  
   Patient data and prediction results (including timestamp and confidence score) are stored in MongoDB Atlas.

5. **Results Display**  
   The result is displayed to the user, and an admin dashboard (`/dbresults`) shows:
   - Total Patients
   - Tumor Detected
   - No Tumor Detected
